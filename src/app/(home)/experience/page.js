We promoted tolerance toward transgender especially, their rights and acceptance to formal education. I launched a slogan, "KEEP YOUR PACKET IN YOUR POCKET" which became very popular and effective on the campus. We conducted a seminar on spot dumping where a sweeper was the chief guest. Its purpose was to honor those who do odd jobs in society and value their work. That seminar created a huge stir in the country. A national TV (JAMUNA TV) and at least 100 online portals published the story. Over the next week after the seminar, I received hundreds of messages and phone calls <br/><br/>

                        *Engaging in educational and developmental research, with the aim of influencing policy decisions and enhancing the education system in Bangladesh.<br/><br/>

                        *Instigating positive societal transformations by disseminating non-academic content that promotes changes in social norms and values.
